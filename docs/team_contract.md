# Communication
## Team Meetings
1. Team meetings will happen on a twice-weekly basis, with the first one of the week happening on Sunday 8pm, and the 2nd on Thursday 8pm (both CT). These timings were chosen as they are clear of any deadlines from other commitmments (CS 233 lab, Math homework, etc.,)
2. Sunday meetings are expected to be longer as deliverables of the week will be decided then, along with crafting specifications for code/deliverables. Thursday meetings are mostly progress checks to decide if any reassignment of roles is required.
3. Meetings will happen over zoom, with one person taking charge of writing minutes on a shared Google Doc (role to be assigned at the beginning of a meeting)
## Assistance
1. A GroupMe chat has been established as the main form of communication between group members.
2. If a question is directed at a particular individual, the respondent is expected to reply by the end of the day, if not immediately.
3. Otherwise, members are expected to check the group chat at least once a day for awareness/potential issues.
## Respect
1. Any ideas should be brought up in the GroupMe chat and attended to by everyone.
2. Should an idea need further deliberation before implementation, it should be in the agenda of the next team meeting. 
3. If there is a need for immediate consideration/implementation, an adhoc meeting may be arranged later that day for discussion. Minimum 2 hour notice required on the GroupChat.

# Collaboration
## Work Distribution
1. Weekly deliverables will be discussed on Sunday's meeting. The parallel nature of the project should allow anywhere between 1 to 4 deliverables to be worked on simultaneously.
2. Due to use of external libraries in this project, one member will be in-charge of maintaining a build manual for the project.
## Time commitment
1. Each team member is expected to put in a minimum of 4 hours of work per week.
2. If a member feels that they cannot meet their deliverable for that week, they are to inform the group chat as soon as possible so that workarounds can be made by the remaining team members.
## Conflict Resolution
1. Most of the team has had prior project experience together, and as such do not expect any major disagreement. Should an issue between team members arise, it will be made known in the groupchat. From there further action will be taken, including hosting an adhoc meeting if necessary.
2. If during the Thursday meeting little-to-no progress has been made by a team member on a particular deliverable, the team will determine if a reallocation of resources is necessary.
3. If a member consistently fails to meet the weekly deliverables, the remaining members must collectively decide to inform the course staff.
